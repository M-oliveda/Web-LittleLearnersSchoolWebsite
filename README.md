# Web Development Project: Little Learners Website

![Little Learners Website Cover](./little-learners-website-cover.png)

This website is a **learning project website** I created to test my **web tech** skills. And also for people to see my development skills and experience.

The project will use an already designed project I found on [Figma templates.](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1308633616415979699/school-education-website-ui-template-light-theme-neubrutalism-free-editable)

For the development of this project, I will use the following techstack: [Next.js.](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS.](https://tailwindcss.com)

This project is developed under an **open-source software license.** Feel free to comment or send a personal message for details or other information.
